# This repository is deprecated.

All the modifications of this fork have been accepted in the NEW upstream version, which is located at https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/.  If you were using this repo for improved timezone report, you can now use the civicrm.php extension for wp-cli that ships with CiviCRM.
